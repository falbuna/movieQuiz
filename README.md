# Project 1

The Movie Quiz can be found here: [https://falbuna.github.io/movieQuiz/dist/index.html](https://falbuna.github.io/movieQuiz/dist/index.html)

## Introduction

We developed this application as a cool way to utilize the movie database API to create an application that would quiz the user on guessing actors and movies.

We used the Tailwind CSS framework, The Movie Database API, Giphy API, and JQuery UI to build, style, and add effects to our application.

## Usage

When the user first enters this page this is what they will see.

To learn how to play the game, the user can click on "How to Play!" for a quick tutorial. There will be a series of prompts that will teach the user how to play the game.

At the end of the tutorial, the user can click on "Start Playing!" where they will be given a choice to choose either to name movies or actors.
